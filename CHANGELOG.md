# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add `within:` time-range selection to checkpoint timelines, activity
  timelines, and combined analysis, with inclusive/exclusive end handling and
  explicit errors when a final mutation cannot be reconstructed.
- Add `compare_many` for collection reports, with batched current-root loading,
  bounded live-association preloading, cross-root prepared history, immutable
  identity-keyed results, and scale-invariant query regression coverage.
- Add opt-in reuse of fully preloaded current endpoints and namespaced
  ActiveSupport runtime instrumentation without automatic logging, including
  end-to-end activity-timeline duration and step counts.

### Changed

- Teach timeline filtering through the shared `Step#empty?` protocol in the
  README and quickstart examples.
- Reuse the live graph loaded by `compare_many` while preparing historical
  association state, and defer root version loading until an edge needs it.
- Reuse collection identity positions and adjacent transition hints so activity
  steps compare only the changed member, and resolve direct nested collection
  owners by foreign key instead of scanning every parent snapshot.
- Reuse prepared predecessor and successor scalar states for isolated activity
  updates instead of reifying and deserializing each PaperTrail event again.
- Preserve both sides of nested collection membership moves by using the
  general comparator when one event changes multiple parent snapshots.
- Preserve per-owner `limit`, `offset`, and owner-dependent association scopes
  in `compare_many` while retaining batched preloading for safe branches.
- Replace lifetime association-identity materialization with an indexed start-state
  checkpoint plus post-boundary activity and current members.
- Bound historical activity-child candidates at the selected end so membership
  changes after the range cannot introduce unrelated empty timeline steps.
- Limit automatic CI to pull requests and `main` pushes, and cancel superseded
  runs for the same pull request or ref.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Add deterministic `Diff#each_entry` and `Diff#each_change` traversal with
  immutable `TraversalEntry` values for renderers, counters, exports, and
  notifications.
- Add immutable version metadata and record references to activity boundaries.
- Give checkpoint `Step` objects `from_boundary` and `to_boundary` readers and
  give both timeline step types an `empty?` predicate.
- Add a Rails-focused quickstart with minimal endpoint, timeline, ignore, and
  association examples.
- Execute selected README and quickstart examples in isolated core and PT-AT
  test sessions so documented behavior cannot silently drift.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Add explicit, bounded nested association paths such as
  `comments.replies.author`.
- Add nested association changes to stable-record diffs and selected subtrees
  to added/removed record snapshots.
- Add path-aware ignore rules while preserving the existing global array form.
- Add root and nested `has_and_belongs_to_many` collection diffs, including
  historical membership, target updates, timelines, and bounded cyclic paths.
- Reload the configured PaperTrail versions association before resolving
  timeline boundaries.
- Rename the root `Diff#record` lifecycle field to the more explicit
  `Diff#record_presence_change`, including its `to_h` key.
- Add `activity_timeline` for adjacent root and selected-descendant version
  boundaries while preserving the root-only semantics of `timeline`.
- Add one-pass `analyze`, bounded association discovery, and structured history
  diagnostics.
- Bound version loads to the requested time range, stream timeline construction,
  and reuse immutable snapshot subtrees across adjacent boundaries.
- Apply event-local snapshot deltas for direct `has_many` membership changes at
  any selected depth and selected non-polymorphic `belongs_to` target events,
  with safe reconstruction fallbacks for other association shapes.
- Reconstruct post-create/update records from PaperTrail's serialized change
  pairs to avoid per-event successor and live-record lookups.
- Derive combined endpoint, root-timeline, and activity results from one
  snapshot pass; advance isolated root changes in place and selectively refresh
  only ambiguous association branches.
- Add `RecordReference`, consistent configuration error subclasses, traversal
  foreign-key suppression, and fail-loud HABTM endpoint validation.
- Fix selective `has_many :through` reconstruction by reifying the hidden
  through collection before resolving target records.
- Prepare timeline record states and association membership once per requested
  range, using indexed resolution for direct relationships, belongs-to-source
  through collections, and transaction-backed HABTM membership.
- Retain point-in-time PT-AT reconstruction as a per-reflection fallback for
  scoped, unversioned, composite-key, and unsupported through shapes.
- Keep multiple selected descendant events in one transaction atomic instead
  of applying an individual event delta before the transaction boundary.
