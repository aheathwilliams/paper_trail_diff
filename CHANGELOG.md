# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Teach timeline filtering through the shared `Step#empty?` protocol in the
  README and quickstart examples.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Add deterministic `Diff#each_entry` and `Diff#each_change` traversal with
  immutable `TraversalEntry` values for renderers, counters, exports, and
  notifications.
- Add immutable version metadata and record references to activity boundaries.
- Give checkpoint `Step` objects `from_boundary` and `to_boundary` readers and
  give both timeline step types an `empty?` predicate.
- Add a Rails-focused quickstart with minimal endpoint, timeline, ignore, and
  association examples.
- Execute selected README and quickstart examples in isolated core and PT-AT
  test sessions so documented behavior cannot silently drift.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Add explicit, bounded nested association paths such as
  `comments.replies.author`.
- Add nested association changes to stable-record diffs and selected subtrees
  to added/removed record snapshots.
- Add path-aware ignore rules while preserving the existing global array form.
- Add root and nested `has_and_belongs_to_many` collection diffs, including
  historical membership, target updates, timelines, and bounded cyclic paths.
- Reload the configured PaperTrail versions association before resolving
  timeline boundaries.
- Rename the root `Diff#record` lifecycle field to the more explicit
  `Diff#record_presence_change`, including its `to_h` key.
- Add `activity_timeline` for adjacent root and selected-descendant version
  boundaries while preserving the root-only semantics of `timeline`.
- Add one-pass `analyze`, bounded association discovery, and structured history
  diagnostics.
- Bound version loads to the requested time range, stream timeline construction,
  and reuse immutable snapshot subtrees across adjacent boundaries.
- Apply event-local snapshot deltas for direct `has_many` membership changes at
  any selected depth and selected non-polymorphic `belongs_to` target events,
  with safe reconstruction fallbacks for other association shapes.
- Reconstruct post-create/update records from PaperTrail's serialized change
  pairs to avoid per-event successor and live-record lookups.
- Derive combined endpoint, root-timeline, and activity results from one
  snapshot pass; advance isolated root changes in place and selectively refresh
  only ambiguous association branches.
- Add `RecordReference`, consistent configuration error subclasses, traversal
  foreign-key suppression, and fail-loud HABTM endpoint validation.
- Fix selective `has_many :through` reconstruction by reifying the hidden
  through collection before resolving target records.
- Prepare timeline record states and association membership once per requested
  range, using indexed resolution for direct relationships, belongs-to-source
  through collections, and transaction-backed HABTM membership.
- Retain point-in-time PT-AT reconstruction as a per-reflection fallback for
  scoped, unversioned, composite-key, and unsupported through shapes.
- Keep multiple selected descendant events in one transaction atomic instead
  of applying an individual event delta before the transaction boundary.
